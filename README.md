# ga_MW_OuterDisk

Here we collect all code related to the Milky Way outer disk component of the SSP. At the moment, this consists of notebooks used to compile and interface
with the observational data presented in Green et al 2019 ( https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...887...93G/abstract ). These notebooks include the
code used to get the counts information and the observational data plots presented in the current draft of the SSP. The code used to interact with the 
N-body simulations presented in Hunt et al 2021 ( https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.508.1459H/abstract ) is all hosted on SciServer, which is 
also where those data live. If you'd like to access that code + those data, email cfilion@jhu.edu. For completeness, I include a notebook that has the code
to generate the plots included in the SSP. However, this notebook relies on having access to both the simulation data and the reader scripts et cetera.
